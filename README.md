learning the ropes 
Hey you, I'm Azaria and outside of my old MySpace and Xanga profiles (cringe) I am completely new to the world of coding. I hoping with a lot of determination and whole lot of practice I can have at least an idea of what goes into designing, and maybe one day in the future I might become a front-end designer.
