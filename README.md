<p> Hey you, I'm Azaria, my friends call me Zee, and outside of my old MySpace and Xanga profiles (cringe) I am completely new to the world of coding. 
I'm hoping with a lot of determination and whole lot of practice I can have at least an idea of what goes into designing, 
and maybe one day in the not-so-distant future I might become a front-end designer. </p>
